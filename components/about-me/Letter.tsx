            <p>
              Hello there! I&apos;m Prajwal, a passionate Full-Stack Developer from
              India, currently pursuing my Master&apos;s in Germany.
            </p>

            <p>
              My journey into the world of coding began in 2021 when I built
              TextUtils, a React-based text editor that sparked my love for web
              development. Since then, I&apos;ve been on an exciting path of
              continuous learning and growth.
            </p>

            <p>
              At IT-NETWORKZ Infosystem, I honed my skills as a Salesforce and
              web development intern, laying the foundation for my professional
              journey. Now, I&apos;m expanding my horizons in Germany while working
              on innovative projects that push the boundaries of what&apos;s possible
              in tech.
            </p>

            <p>
              My latest venture, E-Store, showcases my commitment to full-stack
              development and my passion for creating seamless user experiences.
              But what really drives me is the endless potential of combining
              modern technologies to solve real-world problems.
            </p>

            <p>So, now I&apos;m wearing multiple hats:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
              <li>Full-Stack Web and app Developer</li>
              <li>Researcher</li>
              <li>UI/UX Designer</li>
              <li>AI Tinkerer & Hacker</li>
              <li>Creative Problem Solver</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              My mission is to bridge the gap between blockchain, AI, and
              human-centered design, creating experiences that are not just
              technically robust but also intuitive and meaningful.
            </p>

            <p>
              As I continue my academic journey in Germany, I&apos;m excited to
              collaborate with fellow developers and contribute to projects that
              make a difference. Whether it&apos;s discussing emerging technologies,
              exploring new frameworks, or diving into innovative solutions, I&apos;m
              always eager to connect and learn.
            </p>

            <p>Let&apos;s create something amazing together! ðŸš€</p>
